IO Insights from @rauchg

	learnboost.com

	engine.io just got released 

	when developing with realtime frameworks, we need to know what's going on

	1st strategy 

		built-in instrumentation

		require('debug')('wat')

			TJ Holowaychuk's debug module

			https://github.com/visionmedia/debug

			scoping for your node logs 

	2nd strategy

		capture and displays engine.io traffic

		realtime insight into browser / device usage

			how many of your browsers are using socket connections?

		client insight

			1st strategy

			localStorage.debug

				engine.io codebase and the debug module runs both 

				localStorage is like the process.env for the client

			2nd strategy

				Chrome extension

				IO icon inside of WebInspector

				Analyze and document perfroamcne implications




How my ops guy totally changed my talk last week with a single Nginx module - from @northisup

	https://speakerdeck.com/northisup/krtconf-making-disqus-realtime

	https://twitter.com/northisup

	why do realtime?

		getting new data to the user asap

	disqus architecture
		thoonk redis queue
		python glue
		long(er) polling


		thoonk 

			is a queue on top of redis

			implemented as a DFA (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton)

			provides job semantics
				useful for end to end acking
				reliable job processing in distributed system
			did I mention it's on top of redis?


		python glue

			listens to a thoonk queue
			cleans & formats message
				this is the final format for end clients
				compress data now
			publish message to nginx and other firehoses
				forum:id, thread:id, 

		nginx 

			redis / nginx pubsub is effectively free

		disqus.com/jobs

	people chose their devices over apps

	Single Page apps

		Easy way 

			JavaScript app runs entirely in the client
			Server technology agnostic
			can use Backbone
			Poor SEO
			performance hit to download and evaluate JS before rendering

		The Hard Way - the Holy Grail

			bulk of application runs in the server and in the client

			navigate to any page in the application, renders HTML

			must render full page of HTML without access to DOM (or find a faster DOM implementation)


	Prototype structure 

		app directory - runs on both sides
			view using HTML

			module runs in the context of an express router and 


The Bilingual Browser - Dave Cridland - VP Engineering (XMPP) - Isode Ltd

	A delusion offered for sharing

	I think web browsers should speak XMPP and HTTP natively.

	Isode 
		28 employees, 20 engineers
		XMPP
			M-Link
			Swift
		Strong commitment to Open Standards 	
			LDAP, SASL

	Dave Cridland
		Delusional
			wrote the only full ACAP server
			and the only full client

	Use HTTP for application > addressability | delivery

	Use XMPP
		for identity > browser and user
		for microcontent delivery

	You're not going to settle for anything less than aswesome in the applications you create,
		so why seettle for a piss-poor platform?
