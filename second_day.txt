Peter Saint-Andre - @stpeter - https://stpeter.im/files/realtimeconf.pdf

	Jabber - 1999 talk

	The concept of Presence

	XMPP , pub sub

	presence is availability, attention, focus, capability

	ssl/tls everywhere is only the beginning

	internationalization matters

		unicode compliant

		UTF8 , unicode 

	federation matters

	that's nice, but .... 

	presence is so 90s

	near-time apps
	real-time apps

	trigger for spontaneous / intensive interaction

	more interactions now are in mobile devics and web brwosers

	per-app presence in browsers

	XMPP over WebSocket

	don't be scared by the X in XMPP

	angle-brackets are not required

	it's easy to use web APIs like stope.js

	too many people are still working synchronously

	web presence + webrtc 

	lots of presence at large silors,

	please, don't be a small silo...

	presence is the dialtone for the realtime internet

	presence is a catalyst for and byproduct of realtime web


Eran Hammer - The Last Ever OAuth talk - Rethinking OAuth

	Fuck OAuth

	I hate cats
	(I have 3 at home)
	(all named 'that damn cat')

	I'm sorry...

	Quiz Time
		PHP 4
		world shittiest hosting (no https)
		good enough for google
		not OpenID

	Pain
		signatures
		broken libraries
		extensions
		crappy specification

	WRAP - https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/335/

	The scam
		no signatures
		require token refresh
		signatures < stateful client

	OAuth 2.0
		interoberability
		not a protocol
		extensible

	3 years later
		framework
		assertions (saml, jwt)
		no signatures
		hosted applications centric

	OZ

		goals:

		open source
		implementation first
		consumer web
		mobile & native
		realtime & beyond http

Brian Beggs - Enableing EnerNOC's Realtime Data
	
	Get more from energy

	Principal Software Engineer at EnerNOC

	Smart Grid / Green Energy Company

	Based in Boston, MA

	What do they do?

		they put energy back on teh grid by taking power off the grid.

		this is called Demand Response

	OMG

		metal crushes, book binders,

		SYSO = shut your shit off.

		some sites are automated, we can dim lights at some grocery store chains

	Grid operators

		meeting peak demand can be hard, it's usually only a hand full of days a year

		bringing on a new power plant is expensive

		spinning reserve power plants are very dirty

	C & I Customer

		large industrial customers are often charged for Peak Demand Usage

		sometimes it's cheaper to shut down than to run production

		EnerNOC splits a portion of the payment from the grid operator with the customer

	Reducing energy is cool

		ERT = http://www.energyhub.com/smart-meters/

	4 million readings / day
